    title: "About Us"
    text: "The Lake Love story"
    body: "Welcome, I am **Wendy** - the creator behind Lake Love. Lake Love is a lifestyle brand celebrating Canada's fresh water lakes and the state of relaxation they evoke. 
    

    My father, a Bluenose, is the one that introduced me to the restorative effects of hearing, smelling and just being, near water when we cottaged on the shores of Georgian Bay. Later, with my own family, I discovered the beautiful in-land lakes of Muskoka and Parry Sound region for the relaxation to continue. Lake Love apparel is a way to carry that feeling with you no matter where you are.
    
    
    All items are handmade and offer unique, one-of-a-kind character to each piece. I design and create from my small, home based studio in cottage country, on the shores of Georgian Bay - where Lake Love lives. Where is your Lake Love?"
